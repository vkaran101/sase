          <b>Auditing Algorithms: Towards Transparency in the Age of Big Data</b>
          <br>In recent years, there has been growing awareness of and concern about powerful algorithms that mediate our daily lives. For example, Google Search and Facebook both personalize the information shown to each user, while e-commerce sites leverage purchase history to drive advertisements and product recommendations. In many cases, these algorithms make our lives simpler, more efficient, and delightful. However, opaque algorithms can also lead to harmful outcomes, such as politically-polarizing "echo chambers", price discrimination by e-commerce sites against consumers, and even racial discrimination.
          <br><br>
          In this workshop, we will discuss our work towards "auditing algorithms", were we use carefully controlled experiments to understand the data and algorithms used by companies, and assess the impact of these algorithms on normal people. Case studies on Google Search, e-commerce discrimination, and Uber's Surge Pricing will be discussed. Ultimately, we view algorithmic auditing as a way to increase transparency, and inform societal discussions about how our personal data is being collected and used.
